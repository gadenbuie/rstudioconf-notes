## Stars Wars
---

Run the code chunk I magically entered into your console.

```{r, include=FALSE}
starswars <- 
  starwars %>% 
  mutate(
    hair_eyes = paste(hair_color, eye_color, sep = ";"), 
    films = map_chr(films, paste, collapse = ";")
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hair_color)) %>% 
  select(1, hair_eyes, films) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

You now &#x1F52E; have a table called `starswars`

```{r}
starswars
```

---

Notice that both `hair_eyes` and `films` are "overflowing".

--

- The `hair_eyes` column contains two separate concetps: hair color and eye color.

- The `films` column contains multiple films in a single cell.

```r
<separate>(data, <column>, <?into>, sep = "<separator>")
```

---
layout: false

```{r}
separate_rows(starswars, films, sep = ";")
```

---

```{r}
separate(starswars, hair_eyes, into = c("hair", "eyes"), sep = ";")
```

---
## How would you?

Change the name of the columns where hair color and eye color were stored to `hair_color` and `eye_color`.

--

Re-unite hair color and eye color, separated by `/` instead of `,`.

--

```{r}
starswars %>% 
  separate(hair_eyes, into = c("hair", "eyes"), sep = ";") %>% 
  unite(hair_eyes, hair, eyes, sep = "/")
```
