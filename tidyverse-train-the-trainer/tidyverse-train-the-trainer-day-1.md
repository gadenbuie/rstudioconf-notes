## My Goals

1.  Two things I hope to get out of this workshop
      - Techniques for structuring and teaching programming to others
      - How to teach prgramming, interactively
2.  A trick of the trade

## Notes

  - check understanding/awareness: “What would you type into Stack
    Overflow to get the answer to this questions?”

  - *Directed learning*
    
      - flipped classroom, pre-determined path

  - *Guided discovery*
    
      - problem based learning, socratic method

  - *Exploratory learning*
    
      - teacher provides resources and promt then gets out of the way,
        montessori method, unschooling

  - Not everyone is an auto-didact: **You Are Not Your Learners**

## Levels of Learning

6.  Create
7.  Evaluate
8.  Analyze
9.  Apply
10. Understand
11. Remember
12. Be aware of

## How to get good at anything

1.  Get feedback
2.  Get feedback on feedback
3.  Feedback loop

<!-- end list -->

  - reflective practice \>\> 10,000 hours of practice

  - Elizabeth Green: *Building A+ Better Teacher* How teaching works

  - feedback on feedback scales quickly, within \~3 rounds

## Round of teaching: critique of video

Round 1

  - distracting notifications
  - meaningless examples
  - sitting, non dynamic, impossible to see
  - hiding behind the screen
  - lack of engagement with students, no feedback

Round 2

  - `-` narriting during typing actions, pausing at critical moments
  - `+` stopping to explain the error
  - `+` stopping to explain new visual representation when it occurrs
  - `-` involve students in interaction around filenames
  - `+` screen looks similar to the appearance of the students’ screens
  - `+` explaining the use of shortcut keys (e.g. tab completion or up
    arrow)
  - `+` Use of humor
  - `+` User friendly

In the top 3 feedback items for workshops: *good to see presenters make
mistakes*

## More Notes

Be a champion teacher - Lemov

Who are you when you’re yourself turned up to 11

  - Greg Wilson: heavy metal guitarist teacher
  - vs. acoustic guitar at the coffee shop
  - vs. story telling
  - vs. best friend sharing new favorite band

Review examples and have class evaluate with feedback, record the
feedback, then use the feedback to create a grading rubric that is later
used to evaluate later examples as a group. Can seed the group-evaluated
examples with pre-wrriten examples that illustrate key conecpts.

“I’m sorry I’m going to have to ask you to shorten your question.”

Get groups to work together and collaborate in the class to later
continue learning after workshop/class *Wenger “Communities of
practice”*

## Afternoon

Books

  - *Small lessons* – when you don’t have a ton of time, small bits of
    theory to use
  - *The discussion book* – Getting people talking and discussing
  - <http://www.learningscientists.org/> – six methods, backed by
    research, to improve and enhance learning
  - *The Sense of Style* – thoughtful writing, Steven Pinker
  - *Enhancing Adult Motivation to Learn*
  - *Cheating Lessons*

Motivation

Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic

  - Motivators
      - Self Efficacy
      - Utility
      - Community
  - Demotivators
      - Unpredictability (learned helplessness)
      - Unfairness
      - Indifference

Anticipate learner misconceptions: search StackOverflow for common
questions about the topic you’ll be teaching.
