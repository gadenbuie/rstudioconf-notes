## My Goals

1. Two things I hope to get out of this workshop
    - Techniques for structuring and teaching programming to others
    - How to teach prgramming, interactively

1. A trick of the trade

## Notes

- check understanding/awareness: "What would you type into Stack Overflow to get the answer to this questions?"

- *Directed learning* 
  - flipped classroom, pre-determined path
- *Guided discovery* 
  - problem based learning, socratic method
- *Exploratory learning* 
  - teacher provides resources and promt then gets out of the way, montessori method, unschooling

- Not everyone is an auto-didact: **You Are Not Your Learners**
