## My Goals

1.  Two things I hope to get out of this workshop
      - Techniques for structuring and teaching programming to others
      - How to teach prgramming, interactively
2.  A trick of the trade

## Notes

  - check understanding/awareness: “What would you type into Stack
    Overflow to get the answer to this questions?”

  - *Directed learning*
    
      - flipped classroom, pre-determined path

  - *Guided discovery*
    
      - problem based learning, socratic method

  - *Exploratory learning*
    
      - teacher provides resources and promt then gets out of the way,
        montessori method, unschooling

  - Not everyone is an auto-didact: **You Are Not Your Learners**

## Levels of Learning

6.  Create
7.  Evaluate
8.  Analyze
9.  Apply
10. Understand
11. Remember
12. Be aware of

## How to get good at anything

1.  Get feedback
2.  Get feedback on feedback
3.  Feedback loop

<!-- end list -->

  - reflective practice \>\> 10,000 hours of practice

  - Elizabeth Green: *Building A+ Better Teacher* How teaching works

  - feedback on feedback scales quickly, within \~3 rounds

## Round of teaching: critique of video

  - distracting notifications
  - meaningless examples
  - sitting, non dynamic, impossible to see
  - hiding behind the screen
  - lack of engagement with students, no feedback

Round 2

  -   - narriting during typing actions, pausing at critical moments

  -   - stopping to explain the error

  -   - stopping to explain new visual representation when it occurrs

  -   - involve students in interaction around filenames

  -   - screen looks similar to the appearance of the students’ screens

  -   - explaining the use of shortcut keys (e.g. tab completion or up
        arrow)
