## Keynote - Explicit Direct Instruction in Programming Education @felienne

- How to teach programming (and other things)
- "Everyone should learn programming"
- There is no wall between "users" and "prgrammers"
- Skill progression demonstrated by uesrs in Scratch: Scaffid & Chambers
- Sound matters: "I have a tear ... in my pants" (you have to go back and re-read "tear" in the correct way)
- Coding lacks "fights", i.e. pedagogical debates
  - e.g. _phonics_ vs _whole language_
  - or e.g. "The Math Wars": memorization vs. exploration and problem solving
- "Technology is covert philosphy"
- Whiy minimal guidance does not work - Kirschner
- The use of worked examples for problem solving - Sweller & Cooper

How to teach programming

- Vocalize syntax
- Explicit reading strategies
  - In reading: 
    - skim pictures, 
    - read first sentences, 
    - preview text before reading in detail, etc.
  - In code:
    - Skim methods
    - Collapse code chunks
    - read function signatures
- Assessment and formative feedback

Motivation leads to skill (virtuous cycle)
